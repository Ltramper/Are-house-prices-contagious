# A-visualisation-of-the-housing-market
Visualization of the housing market in terms of price per m4 with a color gradient.
---------------------------------


Summary:

This project works step by step to get a visualization of the housing market in terms of price per m4.

This is translated into a color gradient and plotted on Google Maps with a scatter plot.

The final step is to plot each scatter plot per time unit (within this project a month has been chosen). The plots can then be played one after the other to see the trend in house prices over several years
