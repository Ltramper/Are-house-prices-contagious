# Are house prices contagious?

---------------------------------


&nbsp;



The value of a house in the Netherlands is determined by various factors. One of these factors is looking at comparable houses in the neighborhood.
With this factor in mind, the following question can be asked:

<font color='blue'>Can an expensive house sale cause a ripple effect of an increasing house pricing and can this ripple effect be followed and predicted?</font> 


In order to be able to compare the house prices with each other, it has been decided within this project to calculate the price per square meter. However, this also has disadvantages since houses with certain elements (such as a new kitchen, a garden or near a highway) can influence the price.

Within this project it has been decided not to include these influences yet. This allows the whole project to be generalized. From there, it is always possible to include more variables.
